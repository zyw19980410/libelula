                    Shopping is an activity in which a customer browses the available goods or services presented by one
                    or more retailers with the potential intent to purchase a suitable selection of them. A typology of
                    shopper types has been developed by scholars which identifies one group of shoppers as recreational
                    shoppers,[1] that is, those who enjoy shopping and view it as a leisure activity.[2]
                    Online shopping has become a major disruptor in the retail industry[3] as consumers can now search
                    for product information and place product orders across different regions. Online retailers deliver
                    their products directly to the consumers' home, offices or wherever they want. The B2C (business to
                    consumer) process has made it easy for consumers to select any product online from a retailer's
                    website and to have it delivered relatively quickly. Using online shopping methods, consumers do not
                    need to consume energy by physically visiting physical stores. This way they save time and the cost
                    of travelling. A retailer or a shop is a business that presents a selection of goods and offers to
                    trade or sell them to customers for money or other goods.
